<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello, and welcome to my website! I am Zipeng Ling, currently working as a Software Engineer Intern at Bosch. Prior to this, I obtained my B.Eng degree in Communication Engineering from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

At present, I am working closely with Prof. [Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io/). Previously, I had the privilege of collaborating with Prof. [Xuming Hu](https://xuminghu.github.io). Before this, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Shichao Pei](https://scpei.github.io/). Earlier, my research began under the supervision of Prof. [Zhuying Li](http://zhuyingli.info). It is also my honor to work alongside [Yue Huang](https://howiehwong.github.io/), who has always been offering me guidance throughout this stressful yet amazing journey. Additionally, I am grateful for the long-term collaboration with Prof. [Yao Wan](http://wanyao.me/). **Feel free to reach out ([zpling0816@gmail.com](mailto:zpling0816@gmail.com)) if you are interested in my research.**

# 💡 Research Interests
- **LLM Reasoning**: While LLMs can solve extremely challenging problems and produce correct outputs, their reasoning processes and thinking paradigms often remain flawed and unclear.
- **Trustworthy LLM**: Through enhancing LLM reasoning to be more unbiased and transparent, we can expand the applications of LLMs in high-risk fields like Legal Consultation and Medical Treatment.


<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision.  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->

# 🎯 Misc.

I was born in Suzhou, China, a city long famous for its prosperous economy and beautiful gardens 🏙️, where [EMNLP 2025](https://2025.emnlp.org) will be held.

As for my taste 🍜, contrary to the stereotype many people may have about locals, I can handle 🌶️ spicy food (Sichuan Cuisine) very well!

I love playing video games 🎮! My Valorant ranking in Asian servers (particularly Hong Kong and Tokyo) has reached **Platinum**.
